### The Area

- Undiscovered land
- settlements affronted with constant stream of unknown horrors
- Has an unaccountable amount of spoken lore and wise tales
- Holds many unexplored ancient ruins
- Holds valuable materials and ores

#### Why people are settling to & exploring the area
- Rich people wanting their own dominion/space
- Large groups of people seeking wealth
- Large groups of people seeking adventure
- Sovereign citizens reaching out to create their own utopia
- Weird hippy cults looking to expand theirs mind and reach the hearts of more
- And many other weird and interesting groups striking out to create their own utopia or leave their mark

### Monster Hunter Guild

- There exists a larger Monster Hunter Guild outside of this new found land and it has decided to expand into it. 
  - MHG, the guild/company, is a democratic cooperative where each branch's head/manager is allowed a vote for policies and directives that the guild branches will try and implement. Every 4 years a new branch manager can be elected by the local branch constituents/employees. There is a ton of more minutia that can be defined, but I'll leave it at that.  
- A newly established Monster Hunting Guild has been created and its members are made up by imported company people and local settler volunteers
- This new branch is relatively small as it preliminary test to see if the new site can be successful or not in this new found land
- Branch is headed up by a relatively seasoned veteran of the guild with the small quirk of having multiple, but functional, personalities 
    - Why he has multiple personalities is never, and never will be, explained
    - Due to the branch's size all its missions go through the branch manager
- This branch's HQ is located in a walled off compound in a relatively central spot to many new settlements and happenings to reduce down average incident times.
- This branch has been established for two years and it has two more years before it has passed its 4 year efficacy test. 
- The HQ itself is also small which is representative of it being a test site so it has limited resources and staff in comparison to its sister branches. However, as time progresses if this branch can prove itself it can enjoy more resources, better/more support staff, and better/upgraded gear/tools.

#### Monster Hunter Guild Roles

**Support Staff**
- Branch Head/Manager: Leader of the branch and if the volume is not too great they will be the sole distributor of missions
- HQ Wizard: The wizard who maintains the drop box connections/magical network and if the volume is not too great will provide additional information on arcane magics, lore, and monster facts.
- Drill Sergeant: A senior hunter who likes being mean and running people into the ground, if the branch is large enough otherwise the Branch Head does this job as well.
- HR Person: A person named Matt, or Linda who honestly does no work, but will try to enforce company policies such as Pants Only Fridays and "Checking Your Bias Often" Mondays to ensure that company staff is relaxed and unbiased. One important addendum to add about becoming an HR person is that to become one you have to legally change your first name to be Matt or Linda as such when dealing with multiple HR people at once they are to be delineated by their surnames such as Linda P. or Matt M. otherwise they are just Matt or Linda.
- Cook: He cooks *things*.

**Risk-their-Lives-on-a-daily-basis Staff**
- Assessor: A seasoned company person who is able to go out to incidents and be able to report back to HQ without dying
- Assessment Group: A group of fresher people who do the same job as the assessor, but only exist when there is not an available Assessor.
- Hunters: The people who actually do the job/mission.

#### Monster Hunter Guild Characters:

- Branch Manager/Drill Sergeant/Sometime-Assessor-rescuer/Sous-Chef/HQ-Wizard-Intern: The branch manager is a being with multiple personalities, which will ***never be explained***, that also possesses illusion magic so it is unknown what their true form looks like, but below are the known variants. Despite all this they fulfill multiple jobs and have pushed their branch through the ranks of the Monster Hunter Guild as one of the good ones. 
  - Known Variants:
    - Sergeant Trevor:
      - looks like a human man with an average Thicc build, with kind eyes, a large head, and buzzcut with full beard. 
      - Has a nonsense attitude and is incredibly overworked. 
      - Attempts to sound like a drill sergeant
    - ...Some more probably
- HQ Wizard: Tim (The Tim)
  - A powerful wizard who is incredibly lazy and known throughout the land who is now doing simple organizational magic work
  - Looks like Gandalf talks like Mike Tyson.
- HR Person: Matt \#7
  - One of your standard HR Matts always trying to create pointless events to increase morale or reduce company liability. 
  - Khakis and a button up. 
  - Clean shaven. 
  - Annoyingly Chipper exactly like Linda, but a male variant.
- Cook: Cook Williams
  - A stereotypical looking troll with hunchback and severe back problems from working in a kitchen too small. Has a stereotypical monster gravel voice. Only wears a chef hat and apron.
- Assessor: Dirk Heavimetal (He-vi-me-tahl)
  - Long face, long hair. Jet black hair
  - brown duster with the rest of his apparel being cowboy vibes
  - Has a missing arm from a previous hunt. 
  - Has a country gravel voice.
  - Has a heart of gold and does his work for the people not for money.
  - Has a very terse speech pattern.
  - Thorough.
- Variable Amount of Hunters: A fluctuating amount of hunters stay at this guild as some are using it as a way station for other jobs or simply out on missions so their can be any number between 5 to 30 hunters staying at this branch's castle.

#### Monster Hunter Keep Layout

- This particular MHG Branch found its primary residence inside a *not fully explored* ancient keep with a court yard and stable. The reason for why it's not fully explored is due to a mixture of having a small staff, it being mildly haunted, there being collapsed hallways, and the branch manager having a deep seated desire to make money over battling ghosts. The ghosts are a mix of hostile and friendly, and I will not go any further than that.
- Dorms: Part of the keep holds the sleeping chambers that have been converted into dorms for space efficiency.
- Small Office: A large bed chamber was converted into an office space for the HR person, Branch Head, Assessor, maybe the Drill Sergeant, and HQ Wizard to work in. Yes, there are cubicles, but the HQ Wizard's has a door and its top is covered *for reasons*.
- Armory: Where new gear would be kept if nosey adventuring recruits didn't plan a heist every other week. As such, the rampant theft among the branches caused the cooperative to decide armories are to be just landing zones for new gear that is to be dispersed under the discretion of the Branch Manager.
- Stables: Where the horses, row boats, and rowdy recruits are kept.
- Kitchen/Food Hall: A once haunted cooking and eating area for the staff.
- Courtyard: The interstitial area of the keep and its walls and generally you'll find recruits training here or hunters about to set off to a Mission here.

#### Missions

- The MHG has a magical drop box maintained by the local HQ Wizard that they can drop in any location and any concerned citizen, individual or being can drop a letter into it describing their plight, any additional location information, and, if they are willing, what they are willing to pay/give and it will arrive back at the Branch's HQ. Effectively, a fantasy fax machine.
- Once the piece of paper or whatever has been verified to not be a prank or worthless a MHG Assessor/Assessment group will be sent out to the location to:
  - A: Assess the situation
  - B: Quote an expected cost if any
  - C: Then hopefully report back (If they can't it becomes a rescue mission)
- Payment is not always required as some hunter groups can opt to do work pro-bono if they desire
- Mission transportation is generally handled either through horses/buggies or, if the mission has an aquatic nature, boats. One thing to note, is if the guild has an abundance of wizards and money they can use the magical fax machines as a way of teleportation; this small branch has neither.

#### Recruitment/Training

- The MHG Magic drop box also doubles as an recruitment advertisement with catchy slogans like "Hate Monsters? We do to! Join us today!" or "Got Monsters? No problem!" followed by a quick blurb stating that interviews are available at the local MHG branch HQ from 2pm to 5pm. 
- MHG Branches generally accept as many as they can, but they minimally will put all recruit applicants through a physical test and an aptitude test to ensure their training aligns with what they are good at.
- MHG Branches generally train their recruits at the local branch they are recruited at either by the Branch Head or equivalent drill sergeant
- MHG Branches recruits generally start as Hunters and as they get more skilled they can progress into new roles if they so desire 

### Jump Start Character Questions

You do not have to fill out any of these questions they simply exist to get some creative juices flowing.

- Why does your character want to fight monsters?
  - Money?
  - Power?
  - A weird way to commit suicide?
  - Alternative Anger Management and therapy? Are the monsters a metaphor for your dad?
- Is your character a MHG company person?
  - How long have they worked there?
  - Did they transfer here for a reason?
- Is your character a settler?
  - What settlement are you from and what did you do? You can reference [why people are settling and exploring the area](#why-people-are-settling-to--exploring-the-area) for ideas
- Is your character a weird jungle person?
- Is your character also a monster?

### One Off Stuff

- When making a one off feel free to ignore as much of this as you want. 
- You are not limited to the "Area" you can go do a mission on Bean Island for XYZ if you wanted.
- Also, the Branch Head having multiple personalities was so there was an easy cover up on why he/she might sound and act different every time someone swaps off.
- Feel free to tweak/change literally everything between games as that can easily be explained or ignored like it never happened like when Bikini Bottom got crushed by the Alaskan Bull Worm and had no future ramifications for the show.
