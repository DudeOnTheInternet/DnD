Small note, all of this can be up to the GM's discretion. Meaning you can do whatever the fuck you want
as long as you are not a dick and prioritize making the game fun.

## World Questions

1. What type of theme do we want for this world?
   -  is it gonna be high fantasy, grim dark, or is 
   each DM's narrative/section gonna be it's own 
   thing?
   - How will technology be handled?
   - Also with that are we assuming we're on the same 
   planet?

2. How big of narrative control does each DM get?
   - Can they define whole countries, continents, worlds .etc?
   - Is it kosher to use another DM's favorite NPC or group/faction?

3. How will time be handled? Will everything take place in the same era or will/can things be all over the place chronologically?

4. How big will each campaign be?

## World Answers:
---
1. What type of theme do we want for this world?
 - "Middle" fantasy. Meaning kinda explained with the bullets below.
   - "Most people know a wizard, but most people are not wizards"
   - Urban areas are more accustomed to magic
   - Rural areas are the opposite
 - "Advanced" Technology is fine as long as it is explained by the narrative or  in a fantastical way 
 - We're assuming we are on the same planet
 - Campaigns/sessions don't need to have an overarching plot, but should at least connect/be related.

2. How big of narrative control does each DM get?
 - No hard lines about topography of the campaign. You can feel free to place a hot desert right next to the arctic if you want.
 - Use discretion for carving out parts of the map, but feel free to not even use the map.
 - You should be able to incorporate other material created from other campaigns and DMs, but you should at least ask for permission and describe what you are trying to use the material for. 
 - It is fine to build up a repertoire of plot hooks/Villains/Characters for other DMs to use.

3. How will time be handled? Will everything take place in the same era or will/can things be all over the place chronologically?
 - We will try to stay in chronological order when dealing with the same set of characters. No time skips unless agreed upon

4. How big will each campaign be?
 - Games will generally be more casual, but 
 - Agge will make a sweet ass "huge" campaign that will span "10 centuries 50 years and 10 days". Time scale is relative.
 - Nivag plans on making a longer running campaign.

5. What is off limits?
 - Everything is fine up to an extent.
   -  No campaign placed in a child slavery whore house.
 - No awkward silences. One awkward silence and it's game over man.
 - No weird fetishes.


## Player Character Questions
---
1. How much narrative control do players get?

4. Player balance? Magical Weapons?
5. Should we able to make our own monsters?
6. Milestones vs Experience?


## Player Character Questions
---
1. How much narrative control do players get?
- Players should be able to define parts of the world/backstory as long as they collaborate with a DM or at least later collaborate to define out how that will play in the current campaign.

2. How many PCs is too many PCs?
 - Try to limit to a singular set of characters and maybe another set if the other narrative is good enough or won't too confusing.
 - Feel free to drop characters and feel free to recreate characters on character deaths.

3. Character death? A lot? Never? Some where in between? How to handle character death?
 - We all rather it would not happen, but if the dice and decisions dictate it then that's what it is gonna be. 
 - Death should be meaningful.
 - There should be warning signs.
 - Players should have agency in those last minutes like last words or even describing their own death.
 - Death shouldn't be bullshit. A boulder hit you and you fell of a cliff.

4. Player balance? Magical Weapons?
 - The answer for use of magical items is yes.
 - When handling over powered players with crazy over powered magical weapons try to talk about making the magical weapons less over powered by limiting its use, making simply weaker, or making it do something else entirely. Again assuming players will cooperative and understanding that the game is about the story and the game being fun for *everyone*

5. Should we able to make our own monsters?
 - Create your own monsters within reason and try to base it off any other stats.
 - Feel free to lie about stats if you feel like that monster should live longer

6. Milestones vs Experience?
- Milestones

## Misc Notes But still Important:

- Let's have a "long rest" after we level up: 
  - Answer Questions the players had
  - Time for Feedback

- We are more story focused group of players. The narrative should take precedence over mechanics.
- Nivag wants to make the League of Villains.
- There two suns for two sunsets. Physics do not apply. 
- Every 100 years there is no night time for a whole year. What the fuck does the orbit of this look like. We are in year 69.420 of 100
- Every 574 years two moons come back and double eclipse the suns causing a full year of night, fuck your physics it's magical.
  


## Questions Left Unanswered

- Does the rule of cool supersede game rules? Or rather what is actually plausible in this game? How do you handle the case of when a player wants to flip a dragon with one arm while doing an ollie of his skate board? Does a Nat 20 actually allow him to do that?
 
- What do you do on Nat 20s and Nat 1s? Should there be any homebrew rules about "Critical Failures"?
