Reef returns to the  MHG.

 

Sergeant: "WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN REEF?  YOUR UNIT IS OUT!"

 

Reef: "Gotta ride while the tide's high," he reads from a paper that he saved to remember the saying later.

 

He asks if Reef knows what briefing he was supposed to read for the mission.  They go over the details that Reef obviously didn't read very hard.

 

He gets a horse from the stable and meets the party while they are finishing up last session, at the Black Hawks Guard station.  He falls off his horse HARD.  The horse runs into the guard building, gets spooked, and takes off into the woods.

 

They see a guard with black horns who is apparently spawned from hell.  His name is Dave, but not DGK.  That's all on him.

 

Ben Black gives Reef an amulet for the alert spell.  This is Ben Black:

The party heads to the lakes behind the manor.  They pass by the stables and see Prancer in the barn, prancing with his horses and ribbons.

 

The party debates about what to do but decide to talk to Prancer.  Krux whistles it to a stop.  Prancer is a little annoyed and comes over asking what they want and why they're coaxing his horse, Apollo.  Krux asks about what's going on with the lemons!  He also asks about a monster being seen and with the walking lemon his dad has claimed to see.

 

He doesn't really seem to know much.

 

Krux asks about any enemies Lemonburg might have.  Prancer says his dad crushed numerous people to get where he is, and also doesn't have many friends in the lime industry.

 

Krux is about to let him go, but Prancer asks if anyone else sees weird stuff in the lemon orchard, for example, imagery of himself.  But he cannot get close to it if he tries.

 

Reef asks if he's been taking any sleep medication, but he says he hasn't.  They begin talking about how Reef glistens and he attributes it to his slime coat.  Prancer asks for some mucus, but Reef says it's crossing a line.  So he offers to buy it from Tummy.  They haggle over money and can't come to an agreement.

 

Krux asks about Dasher.  He went and joined the military, not long ago.  He joined the local militia and is helping try to reform the area and make the world a better place.

 

Before they leave, Krux tries to call Apollo again.  It doesn't work.

 

He points them to the lakes, and mentions they're outside of the alert sphere, so be careful.  The party heads that way.

 

They come up to a lake that is just titled "Lake."  They see a fair amount of lemon peels scattered around the lake.

 

Krux goes to pick up a lemon peel.  It looks like someone maybe took a knife to it.  It smells like it was a fresh lemon.

 

Reef jumps in the lake.  It is very dark, even just a few feet in.  He relays this to the party.  Tummy jumps in and they head to the bottom.  They swim for a couple good minutes and don't hit the bottom.  Reef starts to wonder if it's never-ending.  They vaguely remember knowing about something like an endless water pit, but don't remember.  They swim up to ask the others about this topic.

 

Mano remembers talking to Tim, and that it's possible a powerful monster can magically make a space seem to stretch or condense, as an illusion.

 

After a couple more dives, they give up on the bottom of the lake and start looking around for the muddy spots from DGK's note.  They start looking for any mud or footprints, but decide it must be a different lake's shore. 

 

They see a path along the lake and follow it to "Lady's Lake."

 

They see a nice gazebo and some nicer brick paths here, one leading out from the castle.  They do also see some muddy areas and footprints.

 

Tummy gets the feeling they seem humanoid.  Reef and Tummy sniff and taste the dirt, then dive into Lady's Lake. 

 

Mano heads to the gazebo and sees a picture of Lady Lemon and some flower pedals strewn about.  Seems like a shrine of remembrance.  The back of the portrait says it is from a couple months or so before her death.

Krux heads around the lakeshore.  He gets the vibe this area might have once been a part of the alert sphere but was removed for one reason or another

 

Reef and Tummy are able to reach the bottom of this lake.  They see a stone structure with a grate in it in the bottom.  It doesn't seem removable, just allowing the passage of water.  They are able to break an opening in the bars.  They go back up to the surface and tell Krux and Mano about their plan to dive into the tunnel beyond the grate.  They agree to rendezvous at the gazebo in an hour.

 

The hour is late.

 

Mano and Krux head back to Lake Lake to the path toward the 3rd lake.  All of the sudden, some webs shoot out and grab them (restraining them) and two of these guys drop down:

Reef and Tummy go down the tunnel, which is no longer all water, and they see a crypt.  They walk in and see some valuables…
