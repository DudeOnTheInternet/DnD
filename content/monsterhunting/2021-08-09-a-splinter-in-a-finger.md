In the keep, Director Sergeant Trevor asks the group if they've read the briefing for their next mission.  They haven't.  He's pissed about it and gives them orders for another mission--to go to Steelwood and solve their mysterious problem.  There was no Assessor sent to see what was up, so they are going in blind.

They travel by cart to Steelwood, about a 3 hour horse-cart ride away.

They take with them a bear trap, a 10 foot pole, a net, a crate of sea pickles, and a jar of coconut butter from the armory.

They arrive at Steelwood and see a lot of homes destroyed by vines growing into them.  Krux cuts one and it regrows pretty quickly.

They go to the town hall and meet with Maestre John Finger, their appointed contact.  He says the vine attacks started when they cut down an ancient tree in the forest.  He directs the party to the tree in the forest.  The party also now notices no men are in the town…aside from Finger, but they try not to assume genders.

On the way, they see the lumber mill.  The wood that has been cut from it and sent down the river is giving them bad bad vibes.

They arrive and see the big ancient tree has been cut down.  Once they move past it, on the opposite side of it that the city exists, the bad feeling goes away.  Mano and Toke see the creek alongside them and remember that walking down one will often take you to a Fey cave.  Given the circumstances and setting, they think this likely.

Toke and Krux leave to grab the other party members that will be arriving soon.

Reef and Mano continue on down the stream.  They walk into a Fey cave, as expected.  They come to a dead end and see a pedestal that the water goes around, along with a wall that has three holes with element signs above them: water, fire, and air.

Reef magically lifts a small wall of water into the water hole.  It lights green.  Mano shoots a fire bolt into the fire hole.  It lights green.  Reef lifts some mud into the earth hole.  It lights green.

Nothing else happens.

They remember that the Fey require offerings to enter their area.  The offerings to the pedestal usually must be something aligned with their love of debauchery. 

Reef decides this means to stick his ass on the pedestal, and does so quite quickly.  It burns and gives him damage.  They decide to offer sea pickles.  After 5, the pedestal "progress bar" glows green and they are let in.

They walk into a beautiful bioluminescent forest, with a bridge spanning over a pond.  They hear chanting in the distance, and follow it.  Reef is not sneaky enough and gets tied down by vines.  Some dryads come out of the forest and ask them what they're doing.

Reef and Mano explain (after Reef is freed) that they are ambassadors for Steelwood, here to make things right.  The dryads are pisssssssed and basically tell them that the townspeople need to leave and stop cutting trees immediately.

They explain that the curse of Licheros is apt to be released upon the town.  They are chanting to keep Licheros contained within the earth, since the ancient tree's powers (along with the other magical trees) are no longer protecting the barrier.

The players see the men that had disappeared from the town in the trees' bark, also chanting.

Mano tries to be diplomatic, but the dryads are NOT having it.  Mano and Reef head back to get the rest of the group and talk to John Finger…
