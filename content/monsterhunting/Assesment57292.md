title: "Assessment Report 57292: The Lemonburg File"
---
On the 3rd ten day of Spring in the year 714, HQ dispatched me to the Lemonburg Manor formally known as the Ashen Castle after receiving 9 distressed messages about a monster stealing fruit.

Upon arrival, I was greeted by Ben Black, a captain of the mercenary group called the Black Hawks that have been hired to guard the manor premises. He informed me that the issue has been ongoing for the past 3 months and directed me towards the manor grounds after giving me a small token that would not trigger the alarm spell surrounding the manor. 

I assessed the grounds, noting the large lemon farm that surrounds the manor and river that bisects the manor, and noticed several bare lemon trees by the river. I preceded to speak with Mr. Lemonburg on the steps of his Manor and he stated that the cause of the missing lemons was due to the old groundskeeper, Dave Groundskeeper (DGK), or the local Treant who lives in the surrounding forest quoting "That only a monster would harm his beloved lemon trees". Upon further questioning, DGK was revealed to have not appeared for work in a month's time. DGK's status is currently unknown, but lived on premise in one of the homes inside the manor. In addition, Mr. Lemonburg stated he has seen a large lemon with legs walking about the premises at night calling to him. He attributed it to his new medication to help him sleep. 

After finishing my interview with Mr. Lemonburg I noted the manor having high spectral residues across the manor's rooms implying some form of ghostly activity possibly due to the ancient age of the manor despite the efforts of the housekeeper and butler, Gertie and Mr.Higgentop. Further I noted claw marks on the banks of the small river that cuts through the manor as well.

Due to HQ's current workload I was not able to gather much more evidence and have simply rated this as a level 3 incident given the severity.
