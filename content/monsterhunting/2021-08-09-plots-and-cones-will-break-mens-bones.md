Reef and Mano return from the dryad's cave to gather up the other Monster Hunters and head back to Maestre John Finger.  Finger very much does not want the people to leave the town. 

After much deliberation, the party decides to try and go back to the dryads and take a pinecone to imbue with magical energy so they can convince them that the people of Steelwood are going to grow another forest elsewhere.  Then they plan on attacking the dryads, thinking they are either lying about Licheros,  or he is simply job security.

They go back into the dryad's forest Krux and Terry sneak into the woods and ready for attack. 

Mano and Reef walk back to the dryads and convince them to release the men and imbue the pinecone with magic.  To achieve this, magic is drained from the men, rendering them all unconscious.

Reef heals half of the men and have them carry the other half back to town.  After getting the men on their way, Reef and Mano turn to the dryads…

"We're here to…MURDER YOU!"
