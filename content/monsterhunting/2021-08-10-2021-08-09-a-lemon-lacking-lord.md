The party takes a long rest at the MHK, then goes to the armory to see Trent Helm.

 

Krux buys some studded leather for 45gp.  He gets a receipt.

 

Tummy buys some scale mail for 50gp. He doesn't get a receipt.

 

They don their new fancy gear, then head to Director Sergeant Trevor's office.  He is not there, so Krux peruses around for a minute before DST returns.

 

He talks about the Lemonburg issue.  Lord Lemonburg has The Lemon Gala coming up in 4 days and needs this solved ASAP.  The sooner the party solves his issue, the more money they will get.  He heads off to talk to Matt about Matt wearing pants… or not.

 

The party heads off to the Lemonburg Manor, which resides in Celeste Forest.  As they arrive, they notice a big blue sphere encompassing the manor.

 

They meet Ben Black at the gates around 3pm.  He has been expecting them and mentions how bothpeople and lemons have gone missing.  He gives the group their tokens to enter without triggering the magical alarm.  He asks that they put in a good word with Lemonburg, if they wouldn't mind too much.

 

The party sees the guard shack, which is pretty small.  They see through the blue sphere, an orchard of lemons and silos. Further in there is a gothic manor with various wings, pillars, etc.  A big (10 foot wide-ish) river cuts through the courtyard of the castle.

 

As the party walks the path through to the manor, Krux sees claw marks along the river and some of the trees.  He goes to check them out.  The claw marks go in pretty deep.  They seem pretty sturdy.  He gets the feel the marks may be bestial in nature.

 

Tummy checks out the banks where there are some primarily-bare trees.  He places his hand in the mud and asks for insight from his goddess (Shantay, goddess of agriculture and love, who Ian would love) on why they are not growing.  He doesn't get an answer, but a sensation of anger in response, potentially emanating from the trees.

 

The party continues to the red door with a giant black door knocker.  Tummy knocks very quickly.

 

A man appears, cleaning off a knife.

![]()

He says he is the butler.  He is very spooky and is curious what they want, but does know the MHG has been requested.  He does not want to let them, but Krux and Tummy convince him to let the party see Lord Lemonburg.  He goes to finish with the knife, then comes back to let them in.

 

The party sees a lit grand hall with a high ceiling, dark mahogany, and big chandeliers.  They pass glass cases of lemons on display, along with other rooms and passages.

 

"He's up the staircase on the left.  You'll see… It's the only door that's open up on the second floor," the butler says.

 

Krux tries to get his attention as the butler walks off, but he continues on.  Krux pulls the guys in for a huddle.  They all feel weird about this.

 

Mano checks out the lemons in the pedestal cases.  In each one, he sees a glass cube encasing a hand, holding a lemon.  They just look like lemons!  But there are plaques; one says Prancer, one says Martha, one says Lemon-Lime, and one says Dasher. 

 

Krux looks closer at Lemon-Lime.  It has a vascular bronze arm holding it.

 

Tummy looks closer at Martha.  It is a silver lemon held by a bronze arm.  He notices also, there is a nice family portrait at the top of the stairwell with (assumably) Lord Lemonburg and his wife, as well as 5 kids (2 older in front, 3 younger in the back).  Tummy discerns that Lemon-Lime is probably Lord Lemonburg's name, Martha his wife, and Prancer and Dasher some of the kids. 

 

Krux fist bumps Tummy, then notices Mano saw and awkward fist bumps are exchanged all around.

 

The party moves upstairs and see multiple pictures on the wall, some of family, some of lemons.  As they approach the open door on the next floor, they see steam coming out of the bathroom.  They see bookshelves with more lemon hands and chairs with the backs shaped like lemons.

 

A rotund man with a thick jaw line comes out of the bathroom, wearing nothing but a towel.

![](file:///C:/Users/austi/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.png)

"Ah and who are you? An intruder of my domain?" he says.  He kind of sounds like high Jay Leno.

 

They introduce themselves and talk about how he thinks it is the groundskeeper, Dave (DGK) that stole his lemons, and how he told Dirk Heavimetal about this.

 

Tummy asks about the walking Lemon Monster.

 

"This is something that's been happening for quite some time, but I associate it to some new medication," he says, then asks to get rid of his towel and change.

 

The party obliges and he leaves to change as they "sit," but instead investigate the office.  Krux is suspicious that this Lemonburg is an imposter, and focuses his investigation on this. 

 

Krux eyes a bookshelf down and grabs a book on the history of lemons and gets way too far into it.  So much to the point that…is lemon a word…is it even real…?

 

Tummy has a similar experience but doesn't find it as engulfing.  He finds some papers on lemon shipments.

 

Mano peruses the desk and opens a drawer.  He finds a slightly dirty gardener's glove under some papers.  He shows it to the others.  He pockets the glove.

 

Lemonburg strolls back in with some pantaloons and says "so what was the question you were asking me?"

 

Krux asks about what first happened.

 

Lemonburg talks about how he always keeps track of his lemon trees and how some were plucked when they shouldn't have been a few months ago.  He said he found Dave hiding some in his shack.

 

Krux asks about the location of the shack.  Lemonburg goes to his desk and pulls out a map of the manor and hands it to Krux.

"So it's been going on for a few months.  We found Dave keeping some lemons under his cot.  When confronted about it, he then went missing." Lemonburg says.

 

"How soon after did he go missing?" Krux asked.

 

"After a few months we contacted the MHG about his disappearance, which seemed to be the only time you responded, so probably a few weeks ago.  Then I started to suspect that Terrance the Treant might also be starting to steal the lemons as well, as we had had some heated discussions about the lemons.  Perhaps he was in kahoots with Dave!" Lemonburg replied.

 

He goes on to say he saw the lemon monster, but thought it might be due to the medication he has begun taking. 

 

Krux asks about any pets, and the Lord mentions the family horses.

 

Tummy asks about the butler.  He has been in the family for generations, sworn to the family.  He doesn't know how old he is, but will "serve until he dies."  His name is Alfred.

 

Krux asks about the ghostly presence reported on the estate.  Lemonburg knows no such thing about any ghostly presence on the property and reminds the party it is a new property that he had mercenaries clear out for him.

 

When pressed about how people know about it, Lemonburg says the lower classes love to make up stories, and it is all hearsay.

 

Mano asks about the drug he has taken to sleep.  Lemonburg says it is from a local witch, and he can get the name of it from Alfred, but he doesn't know it.  He says if they need a signature or anything to get that info from Alfred, he'll sign something.  Krux gets him to sign a blank piece of paper.

 

The party leaves to pursue their leads.  They plan to start with Alfred.  They go down the stairs and call out for Alfred, with no response.

 

Krux goes into Prancer's room and sees a lot of pictures of Prancer and horses.

 

\[PRANCER]:

![](file:///C:/Users/austi/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.png)

 

He has a nice, made bed.

 

Krux takes a look in Dancer's room.  It is a very neat room, like Prancer's.  It is less filled with a love for horses, and more like he may have moved out recently.  It's more normal-looking.  Nothing catches Krux's eye and he leaves.

 

Mano works his way to the kitchen.  He hears some violent clanging of pots and pans and stuff as he nears.  He hears a woman's voice say, "Gosh darnit Susan, you've done it again, you don't know what you're doing… You've got to set up for the Gala Grand Meal!"  He sees this woman, assumably Susan, speaking in third person as he enters.

![](file:///C:/Users/austi/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image005.png)

He enters and Susan Sus (Soo) asks if he's the new help, seeming exasperated.   He says no and asks about where Alfred is.  She directs him out the manor and to the right, to the Servants' Quarters.  She asks if he wants to make some extra coin, but he declines and heads out towards her directions.

 

Tummy heads outside to the garden and sees a man he thinks may be the new gardener, tending to some of the trees by the garden shed. 

 

"Excuse me, garden keeper bro," Tummy says.

 

"What's going on?" the gardener says.

 

"I'm with the MHG investigating, what's your name?"

 

"Gred Groundskeeper."

 

"Did you know Dave?"

 

"A little, I know I'm replacing him…"

 

"Did anything stand out to you, anything that he left behind?"

 

"Not really, but his stuff's in this shed, I can unlock it for you if you want."

 

They shake hands and Gred notices It is quite wet.  He opens the shed for Tummy.  It's a 10x10 shack with some gardening tools lining the walls, along with some arbor-esque things and a desk in the corner.  In another corner looks to be a pile of hay shaped like a bed.  Tummy finds a crumpled up piece of notebook paper in the corner.  It appears to be a diary entry from Dave possibly.  Tummy pockets it and exits the shed.

 

Krux walks to the front of the estate, toward the Black Hawks post.  Tummy and Krux see each other, and Tummy joins Krux.  Tummy mentions it, but wants to wait til they see "the other one" before discussing the note he found.  They make their way to the post.

 

Mano walks to the Servants' Quarters, which is like a quaint little Gryffindor common room.  He peeks into a room and sees Alfred.  He asks about the drug.  The drug is a solution.  He went to a local apothecary with a witch and acquired dreamroot and makes a tea with it nightly for Lord Lemonburg.

 

Mano knows dreamroot is generally prescribed for narcolepsy but if you resist that, one experiences hallucinogenic properties.  It is thought that some use it to reach into people's dreams and attune oneself to the spirit world.

 

He catches up with the other party members on their way back and relays the information.  Tummy shows the others his note:

 

"2th Ten day of Winter in the year 713

 

Another hearty day of work completed. Sir Lemonburg said I could rest the second half of the day, but I had to clean up some muddy areas around the lakes in the backyard. I don’t know if it’s the wind or all the rain we’ve had lately, but there have been piles of it around the water over the last few weeks. Probably the kids running around. "

 

The party decides to go investigate the lakes, but first, to see the Black Hawks Guards.

 

They approach the mercenaries around a table playing some card games.  Krux asks about foot traffic and anything unusual about people coming in and out of the estate.  Ben Black says nothing unusual has really happened in that regard due to the tokens they have that stop the alarms.  Upon talking, Krux gets the vibe that there are more military people than just these guys.  Mano asks for a list of all the people who have the tokens currently. 

 

The list (not chronological):

Lord Lemonburg

Lady Lemonburg

Prancer Lemonburg

Dasher Lemonburg

Beatrice Lemonburg

Greg Groundkeeper

Dave Groundkeeper

Gertie

Susan Sous

Alfred Higgintop

<Insert MHG members here>

<Insert mercenary group names of the Black Hawks>

 

Ben then asks if they've talked to anyone about seeing some weird some weird stuff on the grounds.  He describes it as a  "white amorphic being."  He was taking his pipe out one night and saw it.

 

Krux asks about how he saw it at night and how long it's been going on.

 

Ben says as long as the "incident" has been going on.  AKA the tragic demise of Lady Lemon.  She choked on a Lemon, as no one was there to assist her.  This happened about a few years before the Lemon Theft issue started happening. 

 

Tummy asks about the mounds by the lakes and Ben says they don’t really go back there because some rookies have drowned around there.  Seems surprisingly frequent to Tummy and the party.
